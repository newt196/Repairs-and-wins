RX 470 found for 5 dollars. 
		^^^Allot of implications with this.

when checked the following can be deduced.
^^^
- Used for mining(ruined fans)
- Thermal paste was terrible
- Dust everywhere, but only on what matters(visual inspection, you coudltn really tell until opening card)



The fix | Will need to reapply paste 
- GPU 
- Memory modules



What makes me very nervous
- No video over hdmi...or display port. Forgot what I tested
- Fans don't spin...at all. They don't even twitch


What I like after testing
- Lights turn on...no baseline but they look dim
- Card seems to get warm to the touch


(fix)
- new thermal paste
- new fans are coming today
