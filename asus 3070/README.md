Zephrus 3070 

Drivers are good, further testing needs to be done here.

(fixed)Wifi card was damaged
- new wifi antenna was installed with drivers.
- Currently runs perfectly and stays connected.





(fixed)fans are a bit loud, but the thermals seem good after repasting.


(Pending) need to test why the display runs at 165+++ but looks like 60
(basic search - https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/refresh-rate-is-set-to-165hz-but-feels-like-only-60hz.3776525/)

Overall condition outside of that is good
