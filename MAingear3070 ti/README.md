^^^Report on drivers
-All is working as expected. Tested over the weekend and the following are good.
- Temperatures are good and no repaste is needed in my experience
- Cinebench was run and while loud, scores are good and optimal.


(fixed, fringe issue)Keyboard Issues
- Keyboard is working after ribbon reseat.
- RGB is working(has to be reset when restarting or shutdown)
- Keyboard is a bit slow to work in and only in bios(dont notice in normal operation)

(fixed) a general intel wifi card has been installed with proper drivers.


(PENDING) A good clean and wipe down woulddnt hurt 

Just need a new laptop charger and new screws and we should be good here.
