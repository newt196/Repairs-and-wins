Maingear 3070

This one is interesting, and will need to get on onsite notes...but from memory.

- Windows and drivers are good here

- Thermals and processing was good here

(Pending)Cinebench still needs to be run here


 Comes with charger and the frame of the computer was in very good condition.
^^^To my knowledge it will not need a repaste until further testing is done
